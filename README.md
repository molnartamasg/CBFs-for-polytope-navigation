Matlab codes for safety-critical navigation of polytope agents in polytope environments based on a single CBF candidate. These include codes for the numerical simulation of four reach-avoid problems with point and polytope agents, static and dynamic environments, in 2D and 3D.

See details in our paper below. Please cite the paper if you use these codes for your research.
